    \begin{justify}
      \begin{footnotesize}As an experienced software engineer with over four years of professional practice, 
      I specialize in the design and creation of high-quality, highly scalable, 
      and fault-tolerant systems, all while adeptly managing intricacy. My expertise 
      extends to encompass distributed systems, cloud-associated technologies, and 
      micro-services. My hallmark is adaptability, demonstrated by my ability to 
      confidently approach entirely novel and nebulous challenges, swiftly breaking 
      them down and efficiently arriving at solutions. I've also been blessed with a
      mazing colleagues who taught me how to be a team player. A pinnacle achievement 
      in my career is the development of a real-time peer-to-peer communication platform, 
      now serving hundreds of thousands of users daily.
